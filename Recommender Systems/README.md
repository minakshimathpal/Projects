CONTEXT: India is the second largest market globally for smartphones after China. About 134 million smartphones were sold across India in the year 2017 and is estimated to increase to about 442 million in 2022. India ranked second in the average time spent on mobile web by smartphone  users  across  Asia  Pacific.  The  combination  of  very  high  sales  volumes  and  the  average  smartphone  consumer  behaviour  has made India a very attractive market for foreign vendors. As per Consumer behaviour, 97% of consumers turn to a search engine when they are buying a product vs. 15% who turn to social media. If a seller succeeds to publish smartphones based on user’s behaviour/choice at the right  place,  there  are  90%  chances  that  user  will  enquire  for  the  same.  This  Case  Study  is  targeted  to  build  a  recommendation  system based on individual consumer’s behaviour or choice.
