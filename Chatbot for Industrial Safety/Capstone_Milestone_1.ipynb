    "\n",
    "### 2. We totally have 6 datasets so we have 6 ANN models with 3 hidden layers and Dropout, all the models support only in prediction of Accident level I as it contains 309 data out of 425 rows ie 73.92% of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The class/target imbalance is affecting the model's performance. The Accident level I contains 59% of data so that model fits only to Accident level I and not the others with less data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. There were totally 22 models using Count vectorizer, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe. We notice that all these models performed bad despite having their hyperparameters tuned."

It is not possible to create a **bert-base-uncased** or **xlnet-base-uncased** contextual embedding. These models make use of a pretrained models data to producec the augmented data which cannot be achieved without any hardware accelarators. Hence, we drop these 2 techniques\n",
