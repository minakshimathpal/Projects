## Overview
This project uses the most popular classification techniques to predict the outcomes after an extensive EDA and work missing values, and imbalance in data. This project has two parts. Part 1 - Predicting the condition of the patient depending on the received test results on biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions. Part 2 - Build an AIML model to perform focused marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert using the historical database.

### Skills and Tools

Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Classification

## DOMAIN: Healthcare
## CONTEXT: 
Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions. 
University has an internal AI team. Due to confidentiality the patientâ€™s details and the conditions are masked by 
the client by providing different datasets to the AI team for developing a AIML model which can predict the 
condition of the patient depending on the received test results. 
## DATA DESCRIPTION: The data consists of biomechanics features of the patients according to their current 
conditions. Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanics attributes derived from the shape and 
orientation of the condition to their body part.
1. P_incidence
2. P_tilt
3. L_angle 
4. S_slope
5. P_radius 
6. S_degree
7. Class
## PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Demonstrate the ability to fetch, process and leverage data to generate useful predictions 
by training Supervised Learning algorithms.
